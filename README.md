# NLA Lakes Context Tool
This tool was produced by the National Aquatic Resource Surveys (NARS) program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The NARS program conducts large-scale studies of the quality of the nation's waters. One such study is the National Lakes Assessment (NLA).
This tool allows you to input water quality data for a lake you care about, then see it compared to statistically representative data collected by the NLA. You'll view comparisons to the national, regional and state level. This is currently possible using 2012, 2017 and 2022 NLA data for any of eight important and common indicators of water quality:
* Chlorophyll (a measure of algal and cyanobacterial growth)
* Chloride (a measure of water salinity)
* pH (a measure of acidity)
* Secchi Depth (a measure of water clarity)
* Total Nitrogen (another such nutrient)
* Total Phosphorus (a nutrient that can trigger problematic algal and cyanobacteria blooms)
* True Color (the color of water due to dissolved components)
* Turbidity (a measure of water clarity)
