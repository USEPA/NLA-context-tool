# NLA Lakes Context Tool
This tool was produced by the National Aquatic Resource Surveys (NARS) program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The NARS program conducts large-scale studies of the quality of the nation's waters. One such study is the National Lakes Assessment (NLA).
This tool allows you to input water quality data for a lake you care about, then see it compared to statistically representative data collected by the NLA. You'll view comparisons to the national, regional and state level. This is currently possible using 2012 and 2017 NLA data for any of four important and common indicators of water quality:
* Secchi Depth (a measure of water clarity)
* Total Phosphorus (a nutrient that can trigger problematic algal blooms)
* Total Nitrogen (another such nutrient)
* Chlorophyll a (a measure of algal population)
